"""
Defines application-specific settings. This file should not be modified:
user-defined overrides can be added to the site-wide settings file.

The following settings are defined herein:

BDR_ARCHIVE_READERS
    A list of qualified class names, each of which extending the `Archive`
    class defined in the `bdr.utils.archives` module.

BDR_UNCOMPRESS_BIN
    The path to the ``uncompress`` binary (typically ``/bin/uncompress``) or
    another executable that is capable of decompressing the ``compress`` format
    (for example, ``/bin/gunzip``).

    The binary must support receiving data through standard input (``stdin``)
    and the ``-c`` flag for output to standard output (``stdout``).

    This setting is required if the
    :py:class:`bdr.utils.archives.CompressArchive` class is included as an
    archive reader.

    The reader itself should be added with:

        ``BDR_ARCHIVE_READERS = ['bdr.utils.archives.CompressArchive']``

BDR_REMOTE_TRANSPORTS
    A dictionary that maps URL scheme names to qualified class names. These
    classes must extend the `Transport` class defined in the
    `bdr.utils.transports` module.
