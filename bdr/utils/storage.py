    Provides a filesystem-backed storage mechanism that uses delta compression
    to minimise disk space.

    If two files within the same directory share the same root file name, they
    will form a reverse chain where each file is encoded as a delta based on
    the file that follows it (according to file name in lexicographical order).
    The last file in the chain is compressed according to standard lossless
    compression techniques.

    The root of a file name is defined to be that which precedes the last dot
    in the name.

    :Example:
    >>> import os.path
    >>> path = "/foo/test.example.ext"
    >>> name = os.path.basename(path)
    >>> root, ext = os.path.splitext(name)
