"""
This package defines the types used to implement format-dependent export and
merge functionality within the repository, and the plug-in mechanism for
extending it.

Each revision of a file within the repository is assigned a format, which
enables the parsing of its content into discrete fields. The repository
includes built-in support for tabular formats (CSV and DSV, more generally) but
it is recognised that this will not cater for all format types. To this end, it
is possible to introduce format plug-ins to implement other types.
